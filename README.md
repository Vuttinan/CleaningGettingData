==================================================================

From the experimental with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years, each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been collected in to a data set by  two datasets, training and test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) in mean and standard deviation were select by applying the sensor signal. From each variable would be on the CodeBook.md. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer in mean and standard deviation.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope in mean and standard deviation. 
- A 81-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'run_analysis.R': Shows information about the geting and cleaning data on the feature vector.

- 'data_tidy.txt': Data set.

- 'CodeBook.txt': Shows their activity name.
